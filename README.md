The Open Insurance Initiative </br>
https://openinsuranceinitiative.org/
<p>This paper takes a high level overview of the fundamental elements involved in incumbent insurers providing open access to their APIs allowing their customers to freely share with third parties their insurance policy information and much of the data collected on them by their insurers.</p>
<p>OPIN stands for Open Insurance and is a global initiative that sets out to promote deep integration with InsurTech  businesses and other third party service providers. It empowers the customer, heightens competition and most importantly aims to propel the insurance incumbents on a path that fosters better experimentation, accelerates implementation of leading edge technologies and hastens adoption of customer focused disruptive ideas. </p>
<p>The recommendations herein are business-line agnostic, therefore the paper encompasses all lines of business, life and non-life, though the focus is entirely on the individual customer. All technologies and frameworks mentioned are to be only viewed as example approaches providing those engaged in developing the API standard with the flexibility to recommend versatile guidelines and specification.</p>
<p>OPIN will become a community led initiative that could potentially be the largest insurance API project of its kind to date.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the paper is to promote the concept of open APIs in insurance paving the path for future in depth studies. It is hoped that it serves as the catalyst for research and for setting up working groups to draw up the necessary uniform interfaces, processes, implementation plans and time frames.
